[{"body":"Tenets are guiding project principles; they outline and frame design thinking.\nI use tenets for nearly all projects I work on. (I don’t always tell people about them.)\nHere are the ones I generally start with. Unless you can think of better ones…\nDocs are features Many teams treat docs as afterthoughts. Like good software, good docs require design, forethought, and planning.\nEffective docs follow the product lifecycle: design, implementation, review, and maintenance.\nTreat doc reviews as seriously as code reviews. Reviewers need to be proactive and timely in their feedback.\nFeedback must be specific, clear, and actionable.\nDocs solve problems Good docs help people solve problems.\nBefore starting an article, identify the audience and the problem.\nThis defines the intent:\n“As a developer, I want to back up my database.”\n“As a new customer, I want to update my profile.”\n“As an admin, I need to limit access.”\nLike feedback, intent must be specific, clear, and actionable.\nThe article’s complete when it meets the intent. Everything else is extra (and probably goes elsewhere).\nWhen you review an article, test it against the intent.\nSolve first; explain later Most people are in a hurry; they’re trying to answer a specific question.\nGive them the answer. Let them decide what to do next.\nDetails, analysis, and architecture come later.\nWhen planning docs, remember “Breadth, then depth.”\nWork priorities in descending order. Finish what you can with what you have.\nCover basics first and then go deeper. Balance resources, priorities, and feedback.\nWhen you do focus on specifics, start with things relevant to many users, rather than a few.\nWrite for modern audience We have short attention spans and too many distractions. We tend to scan for relevance before diving deep. (Think tl;dr for, well, everything.)\nThis means:\nDesign for scanning. Use simple sentences, short paragraphs, and lots of whitespace.\nBe brief. Be clear. Save details for later.\nUse everyday language rather than industry jargon.\nIf you must use jargon, define it–especially TLAs (three-letter acronyms) and abbrs (abbreviations).\nDon’t assume readers have the same context or background knowledge.\nShow empathy: be direct when things are not ideal. At the very least, don’t be a jerk.\nDocs cannot teach everything Docs help people learn the basics and become self-sufficient.\nIt’s tempting to document every behavior and error condition. Yet, too much detail can overwhelm.\nConsider practical limits and dinimishing returns.\nThe more you write, the more you have to maintain.\nStart with the 80/20 rule. Let feedback and metrics inform updates.\nPublish, then perfect Unpublished docs help no one.\nDocs don’t need to be perfect to publish. You can always push an update.\nFigure out what you can do with what you have. Do it and then iterate.\nMistakes are OK. Accept, learn, and move on.\nIt’s OK to focus You don’t have to accept (or use) every good idea.\nAccept feedback and contributions openly; use those that serve the intent.\nIf something doesn’t fit, throw it in the backlog and file a follow-up ticket.\nActively maintain, review, and triage your backlog. Make time for quality sprints.\nLog and prioritize all requests. Work date-sensitive items in descending priorty order.\nMore about tenets Tenets are part of the Amazon design process. They answer questions that aren’t otherwise addressed by your project docs.\nAt Amazon, every project is expected to feature tenets prominently. (Some projects post tenets publically.)\nBy tradition, you introduce tenets with the subtitle “Unless you can think of better ones.”\nTenets can and do change as projects evolve. This is encouraged.\nI use tenets to frame and clarify. They help:\nSet expectations Outline direction Enable conversation I bring these tenets to every project I work on.

Readers repond well to a friendly tone that is easy-to-read.\nThese principles help.\nUse one clear intent Good docs help users solve problems.\nBefore working on a doc, understand the audience you’re trying to reach and the problem being solved.\nThis is called the intent and is typically expressed as as follows:\n“As a \u003crole\u003e, I want to \u003csolve a problem\u003e.\nExamples:\n“As a developer, I want to back up my database.” “As a novice, I want to create a doc website.” “As a new writer, I want to check the readability of my content.” Good intents helps:\nWriters organize content and know when to stop. Reviewers know the limits and scope of the article. If you’re having trouble outlining an article, take time to consider the intent carefully.\nBe brief Modern readers are in a hurry.\nThey’re not reading your content for entertainment; they’re trying to solve problems.\nDesign accordingly:\nBe direct and concise.\nWrite simple sentences and minimize discussion.\nWrite the simple case first; discuss complications later.\nThe acronym tl;dr is a useful guidepost.\nBe scannable Few people read for depth initially.\nInstead, they scan webpages and try to pick out relevant details before diving deeper.\nStructure your docs accordingly:\nUse short sentences, small paragraphs, and lots of white space.\nMinimize distractions and limit decorations (rules, frames, and blocks of color).\nAvoid distractions, such as elements that move (animated images, autoplay videos, and so on.)\nMove complicated or detailed discussions below summarized answers.\nUse everyday language Many industries have terms and language specific to their domains.\nDon’t assume that your readers know these terms or search on them.\nAs an example, consider the following terms:\nfinetune headunit ingest inference upsert Can you define them clearly? Can your readers? How about people who aren’t already using your product or service?\nInstead, use plain language; define industry terms and jargon.\nShow empathy Some things are hard or complicated. Be up front about it.\nAt the very least, don’t be a jerk.\nDon’t describe something as quick or easy when it’s neither.\nRemove marketing hype and hyperbole.\nFocus on objective, reproducible facts.\nWe’re all learning.

For most web content, this is UTF-8.\nHowever, this may not always be an ideal result.\nHere, we show how to define a custom sort order in JavaScript.\nProcess array To illustrate, consider the following book titles, organized roughly by the year they were first published.\nA Study in Scarlet The Sign of Four The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes The Hound of the Baskervilles The Return of Sherlock Holmes His Last Bow The Valley of Fear The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes To print an array containing these titles to a web page, you might use something like this:\nvar iTotal = astrTitles.length; if ( iTotal \u003e 0 ) { for ( var iTitles = 0; iTitles \u003c iTotal; iTitles++ ) { var str = astrTitles[ iTitles ]; writeTitle( str ); } } Here, the writeTitle() function represents the code needed to display the title on the target device.\nfunction writeTitle( strTitle ) { var obj = document.getElementById( \"pOutput\" ); obj.textContent += strTitle + \"\\n\"; } Example 1: A JavaScript function to write string values to a webpage. (Try it out)\nSort an array When asked to sort the array alphabetically, you might call the Array.sort() function:\nvar iTotal = astrTitles.length; if ( iTotal \u003e 0 ) { astrTitles.sort(); for ( var iTitles = 0, iTitles++, iTitles \u003c iTotal ) { writeTitle( astrTitles[ iTitles ] ); } } Example 2: JavaScript code to sort an array before process it. (Try it out)\nWhen run, this leads to the following:\nA Study in Scarlet His Last Bow The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes The Hound of the Baskervilles The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes The Return of Sherlock Holmes The Sign of Four The Valley of Fear From a technical view, these might be the results you expect; however, your users might have different ideas.\nMove leading articles As an alternative, consider:\nAdventures of Sherlock Holmes, The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes, The His Last Bow Hound of the Baskervilles, The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes, The Return of Sherlock Holmes, The Sign of Four, The Study in Scarlet, A Valley of Fear, The Here, leading articles (a, an, and the) are moved to the end of the title. To some, these results are clearer and more logical.\nThis strategy is common to business filing systems and known by different names, including dictionary sorting and alphabetic collation.\nFor a detailed look, see Section 4.6 (PDF) of “Guidelines for Alphabetical Arrangement of Letters and Sorting of Numerals and Other Symbols”, by Hans H. Wellisch, 1999 National Information Standards Organization (NISO) Technical Report TR02-1999.\nTo create a custom function that does this in JavaScript, you might use something along these lines:\nfunction moveLeadingArticle( sInput ) { var sResult = sInput.toLocaleLowerCase(); var aArticles = [ 'a', 'an', 'the' ]; var aWords = sResult.split(/\\s/); if ( aArticles.indexOf( aWords[0] ) \u003e -1 ) { sResult = aWords.slice( 1 ).join( ' ' ); sResult += ', ' + aWords[0]; } return sResult; } Example 3: A custom function to move leading titles to the end of an input string. (Try it out)\nHere, the input parameter value is:\nConverted to lowercase. Split into individual words. The first word is compared to a list of known articles (a, an , the). When a title starts with an article, the article is moved to the end of the title. Here are a couple of examples:\nmoveLeadingArticle( \"His Last Bow\" ) returns his last bow\nmoveLeadingArticle( \"The Sign of Four\" ) returns sign of four, the\nCustom sort order You can create a custom sort order by passing an anonymous function to the Array.sort() function.\nvar iTotal = astrTitles.length; if ( iTotal \u003e 0 ) { if ( aResultsArray.length \u003e 1 ) { aResultsArray.sort( function( a, b ) { var SortTermA = moveLeadingArticle( a ); var SortTermB = moveLeadingArticle( b ); return SortTermA.localeCompare( SortTermB ); } ); } Example 4: Performing a custom sort using an anonymous function. (Try it out)\nHere, the anonymous function calls the custom function when comparing string values. When run, these titles are sorted in dictionary order (shown earlier).\nExample #3 shows this in action.\nInternational concerns This example essentially demonstrates how to perform a custom sort using JavaScript.\nUnfortunately, the actual algorithm relies on a specific behavior used to sort titles written in English using Latin characters. It might be useful for book lists, music collections, or even video games involving extensive player inventory systems.\nBeyond these cases, the example might have limited value. It doesn’t account for alternate alphabets, collation patterns, or even languages that do not support articles.\nThe Intl.collator() object is typically suggested as a good resource for international concerns. (Unfortunately, few options seem to support this specific scenario for English.)\nInternationalization (I18N) is the art of writing apps to support users and their native assumptions.\nTo learn more, see:\nHandling character encodings in HTML and CSS (W3C) Interational Components for Unicode (ICU) The Unicode Common Local Data Repository (CLDR) Vital statistics Updated: 8 May 2024 - Rewritten to align to current style guidelines, support the site revamp, and discuss the I18N perspective.

Here, I’ve added update to the previous branch name so that a future reviewer might recognize the connection between the branches. Such consistency can help when looking back weeks or months later.\nReset the new branch to a known baseline, such as your remote default branch (origin/main).\n$ git fetch origin main $ git reset --hard origin/main If you receive an error saying Fatal: could not read from remote repository, it’s likely one of the following:\nYou’ve mistyped origin: verify the name of your upstream remote and try again. Your current working directory isn’t (yet) part of your remote branch. Change to a shared directory and try again. Your session credentials have expired; renew your session and try again. Add the desired commits from the original branch:\n$ git cherry-pick saved-commit-id Run this for each saved commit ID.\nReview your local files and commit your changes.\nWhen satisfied, push your new branch:\n$ git push origin broken-branch-upd:broken-branch-upd To finish: create a new pull request (which should be blissfully free from other commits), delete the original (broken) PR, and then clean up your local branches.\nBefoe adding additional commits to your new PR, consider pushing a small edit within the scope of the PR. If this triggers an upstream warning that “changes aren’t tracked remotely,” use the text in the error to set up remote tracking.\n$ git push --set-upstream origin broken-branch-upd Consider doing this now to avoid future surprises.\nReset local default Once you’ve replaced broken branches and pull requests, you will likely need to reset your local default branch (main) to your remote default (origin/main).\nTo begin, check out main, investigate the differences between your local copy and your upstream remote, and then resolve any differences. (Most have likely been resolved while replacing broken ranches.)\nWhen things look good, reset your local default (main) to your remote default (origin/main):\n$ git checkout main $ git fetch origin main $ git reset --hard origin/main $ git status On branch main Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'. nothing to commit, working tree clean Once the working tree is clean, you’re ready to resume your normal activities.\nVital statistics Update\n7 May 2024 - Rewritten to reflect current style and conventions Tested\n8 March 2017 using git 2.10.1, MacOS Sierra 10.12.3 Source material Based on Stack Overflow Question #25955822.\n(My mileage varied, so I wrote this and added my comments.)

I’m blowing off the dust, sweeping away the cobwebs, and setting up a new set of things.\nThis site serves as a practical portfolio and personal knowledgebase. It’s meant to provide samples of my writing style and to illustrate my approach to tecnical writing. It’s also eant to share knowledge and lessons learned during my technical adventures.\nI hope the content is engaging, practical, and has at least a bit of value. (I’m still trying to chase down the various typos, so you’ll have to forgive a few rough edges.)\nThe initial version of the site was built using MKDocs, a static site generator used to create websites from Markdown. The generated results were published using Github Pages.\nThe new version uses Hugo, which I find to be a bit more capable and extensible than MkDocs. (That’s a personal opinion; your mileage may vary.)\nThis post marks the beginning of the new journey. I’m using this to learn a new theme and to refine my technical skills/knowledge.\nInitially, I plan to mine my personal notes for content. I’m also working on backend improvements to improve discoverability, reduce maintenance, and so on.\nFuture posts will discuss various aspects of the process. For now, I’m working on the general site structure and initial content.\nThanks for joining me on this journey.
