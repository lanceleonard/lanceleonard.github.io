Add the desired commits from the original branch:\n$ git cherry-pick saved-commit-id Run this for each saved commit ID.\nReview your local files and commit your changes.\nWhen satisfied, push your new branch:\n$ git push origin broken-branch-upd:broken-branch-upd To finish: create a new pull request (which should be blissfully free from other commits), delete the original (broken) PR, and then clean up your local branches.\nBefore adding additional commits to your new PR, consider pushing a small edit within the scope of the PR. If this triggers an upstream warning that “changes aren’t tracked remotely,” use the text in the error to set up remote tracking.\n$ git push --set-upstream origin broken-branch-upd Consider doing this now to avoid future surprises.\nReset local default Once you’ve replaced broken branches and pull requests, you will likely need to reset your local default branch (main) to your remote default (origin/main).\nTo begin, check out main, investigate the differences between your local copy and your upstream remote, and then resolve any differences.

(Try it out)\nSort an array When asked to sort the array alphabetically, you might call the Array.sort() function:\nvar iTotal = astrTitles.length; if ( iTotal \u003e 0 ) { astrTitles.sort(); for ( var iTitles = 0, iTitles++, iTitles \u003c iTotal ) { writeTitle( astrTitles[ iTitles ] ); } } Example 2: JavaScript code to sort an array before process it.

To some, these results are clearer and more logical.\nThis strategy is common to business filing systems and known by different names, including dictionary sorting and alphabetic collation.\nFor a detailed look, see Section 4.6 (PDF) of “Guidelines for Alphabetical Arrangement of Letters and Sorting of Numerals and Other Symbols”, by Hans H. Wellisch, 1999 National Information Standards Organization (NISO) Technical Report TR02-1999.\nTo create a custom function that does this in JavaScript, you might use something along these lines:\nfunction moveLeadingArticle( sInput ) { var sResult = sInput.toLocaleLowerCase(); var aArticles = [ 'a', 'an', 'the' ]; var aWords = sResult.split(/\\s/); if ( aArticles.indexOf( aWords[0] ) \u003e -1 ) { sResult = aWords.slice( 1 ).join( ' ' ); sResult += ', ' + aWords[0]; } return sResult; } Example 3: A custom function to move leading titles to the end of an input string. (Try it out)\nHere, the input parameter value is:\nConverted to lowercase. Split into individual words. The first word is compared to a list of known articles (a, an , the). When a title starts with an article, the article is moved to the end of the title. Here are a couple of examples:\nmoveLeadingArticle( \"His Last Bow\" ) returns his last bow\nmoveLeadingArticle( \"The Sign of Four\" ) returns sign of four, the\nCustom sort order You can create a custom sort order by passing an anonymous function to the Array.sort() function.\nvar iTotal = astrTitles.length; if ( iTotal \u003e 0 ) { if ( aResultsArray.length \u003e 1 ) { aResultsArray.sort( function( a, b ) { var SortTermA = moveLeadingArticle( a ); var SortTermB = moveLeadingArticle( b ); return SortTermA.localeCompare( SortTermB ); } ); } Example 4: Performing a custom sort using an anonymous function. (Try it out)\nHere, the anonymous function calls the custom function when comparing string values. When run, these titles are sorted in dictionary order (shown earlier).\nExample #3 shows this in action.\nInternational concerns This example essentially demonstrates how to perform a custom sort using JavaScript.\nUnfortunately, the actual algorithm relies on a specific behavior used to sort titles written in English using Latin characters. It might be useful for book lists, music collections, or even video games involving extensive player inventory systems.\nBeyond these cases, the example might have limited value. It doesn’t account for alternate alphabets, collation patterns, or even languages that do not support articles.\nThe Intl.collator() object is typically suggested as a good resource for international concerns. (Unfortunately, few options seem to support this specific scenario for English.)\nInternationalization (I18N) is the art of writing apps to support users and their native assumptions.\nTo learn more, see:\nHandling character encodings in HTML and CSS (W3C) International Components for Unicode (ICU) The Unicode Common Local Data Repository (CLDR) Vital statistics Updated: 8 May 2024 - Rewritten to align to current style guidelines, support the site revamp, and discuss the I18N perspective.

Like good software, good docs require design, forethought, and planning.\nEffective docs follow the product lifecycle: design, implementation, review, and maintenance.\nTreat doc reviews as seriously as code reviews. Reviewers need to be proactive and timely in their feedback.\nFeedback must be specific, clear, and actionable.\nDocs solve problems Good docs help people solve problems.\nBefore starting an article, identify the audience and the problem.\nThis defines the intent:\n“As a developer, I want to back up my database.”\n“As a new customer, I want to update my profile.”\n“As an admin, I need to limit access.”\nLike feedback, intent must be specific, clear, and actionable.\nThe article’s complete when it meets the intent. Everything else is extra (and probably goes elsewhere).\nWhen you review an article, test it against the intent.\nSolve first; explain later Most people are in a hurry; they’re trying to answer a specific question.\nGive them the answer. Let them decide what to do next.\nDetails, analysis, and architecture come later.\nWhen planning docs, remember “Breadth, then depth.”\nWork priorities in descending order. Finish what you can with what you have.\nCover basics first and then go deeper. Balance resources, priorities, and feedback.\nWhen you do focus on specifics, start with things relevant to many users, rather than a few.\nWrite for modern audience We have short attention spans and too many distractions. We tend to scan for relevance before diving deep. (Think tl;dr for, well, everything.)\nThis means:\nDesign for scanning. Use simple sentences, short paragraphs, and lots of whitespace.\nBe brief. Be clear. Save details for later.\nUse everyday language rather than industry jargon.\nIf you must use jargon, define it–especially TLAs (three-letter acronyms) and abbrs (abbreviations).\nDon’t assume readers have the same context or background knowledge.\nShow empathy: be direct when things are not ideal. At the very least, don’t be a jerk.\nDocs cannot teach everything Docs help people learn the basics and become self-sufficient.\nIt’s tempting to document every behavior and error condition. Yet, too much detail can overwhelm.\nConsider practical limits and diminishing returns.\nThe more you write, the more you have to maintain.\nStart with the 80/20 rule. Let feedback and metrics inform updates.\nPublish, then perfect Unpublished docs help no one.\nDocs don’t need to be perfect to publish. You can always push an update.\nFigure out what you can do with what you have. Do it and then iterate.\nMistakes are OK. Accept, learn, and move on.\nIt’s OK to focus You don’t have to accept (or use) every good idea.\nAccept feedback and contributions openly; use those that serve the intent.\nIf something doesn’t fit, throw it in the backlog and file a follow-up ticket.\nActively maintain, review, and triage your backlog. Make time for quality sprints.\nLog and prioritize all requests. Work date-sensitive items in descending priority order.\nMore about tenets Tenets are part of the Amazon design process. They answer questions that aren’t otherwise addressed by your project docs.\nAt Amazon, every project is expected to feature tenets prominently. (Some projects post tenets publically.)\nBy tradition, tenets are introduced the subtitle “Unless you can think of better ones.” This reminds people that tenets can, should, and do change as projects evolve.\nI use tenets to:\nSet expectations Outline direction Enable conversation These tenets are part of (nearly) every project I work on.

If you’re having trouble outlining an article, take time to consider the intent carefully.\nBe brief Modern readers are in a hurry.\nThey’re not reading your content for entertainment; they’re trying to solve problems.\nDesign accordingly:\nBe direct and concise.\nWrite simple sentences and minimize discussion.\nWrite the simple case first; discuss complications later.\nThe acronym tl;dr is a useful guidepost.\nBe scannable Few people read for depth initially.\nInstead, they scan webpages and try to pick out relevant details before diving deeper.\nStructure your docs accordingly:\nUse short sentences, small paragraphs, and lots of white space.\nMinimize distractions and limit decorations (rules, frames, and blocks of color).\nAvoid distractions, such as elements that move (animated images, autoplay videos, and so on.)\nMove complicated or detailed discussions below summarized answers.\nUse everyday language Many industries have terms and language specific to their domains.\nDon’t assume that your readers know these terms or search on them.\nAs an example, consider the following terms:\nfinetune headunit ingest inference upsert Can you define them clearly? Can your readers? How about people who aren’t already using your product or service?\nInstead, use plain language; define industry terms and jargon.\nShow empathy Some things are hard or complicated. Be up front about it.\nAt the very least, don’t be a jerk.\nDon’t describe something as quick or easy when it’s neither.\nRemove marketing hype and hyperbole.\nFocus on objective, reproducible facts.\nWe’re all learning.

(Some sources vary when describing intent and history.)\nTo begin, move reusable functions into a separate JavaScript file (called mymodules.js in this example):\n// myModule.js module.exports.isBlank = function( inputValue ) { var blnResult = ( ( inputValue == undefined ) || ( inputValue == null ) || ( inputValue == \"\" ) ); return blnResult; } module.exports.collectFilenames = function( strTargetPath ) { var oResults = new Object; oResults.paths = []; oResults.paths.push( strTargetPath ); oResults.files = []; var fs = require( 'fs' ); for ( var xDir = 0; xDir \u003c ( oResults.paths.length ); xDir++ ) { var sCurrDir = oResults.paths[ xDir ]; var aThisDir = fs.readdirSync( sCurrDir ); for ( var xThisFile = 0; xThisFile \u003c ( aThisDir.length ); xThisFile++ ) { var strFullFilename = sCurrDir + \"/\" + aThisDir[ xThisFile ]; var xTFStat = fs.statSync( strFullFilename ); if ( xTFStat.isFile() ) { oResults.files.push( strFullFilename ); } else { if ( xTFStat.isDirectory() ) { oResults.paths.push( strFullFilename ); } else { console.log( \"Skipping \", strFullFilename, \"; not a file or directory.\" ); } } } } return oResults.files; } The collectFilenames function shown here is slightly different from the one introduced in Collect filenames. Here, it returns an array of strings an object.\nLimiting the return type to a simple data type gives the module more flexibility, especially with older clients. Subtle errors are easier and calling code tends to be more concise and clearer.\nFunction declaration changes Function declarations have changed as well because Node modules require you to assign functions to the modules.exports object. Thus, your calling code needs to change as well:\nmodule.exports.isBlank = function( inputValue ) { ... } module.exports.collectFilenames = function( strTargetPath ) { ... } As of Node v0.1.16, the module reference is optional for exports defined in the same file.\nCustom module use Once the module is created, you calling code looks something like this:\nvar nbt = require( \"./myModule\"); var fs = require( \"fs\" ); var strFilePath = process.argv[ 2 ]; if ( nbt.isBlank( strFilePath ) ) { console.log( \"Declaration error: Cleanup directory not specified.\" ); return; } var p = require( \"path\" ); var strFilePath = p.resolve( strFilePath ); var aFilenames = []; aFilenames = nbt.collectFilenames( strFilePath ); console.log( JSON.stringify( aFilenames, undefined, 3 ) ); What remains is generally focused on the specific task. Note: If you receive an \"Error: Cannot find module 'example' error when you require your module, try adding a directory reference:\nvar nbt = require( \"./myModule\"); Here, we assume that myModule is located in the same directory as the calling script.\nAdjust as needed to reflect your application structure.\nMore info Node’s full module documentation CommonJS module specification npm’s Creating Node.js Modules tutorial.

It has more content and a more professional pipeline.\nI have to admit that I was a little worried when starting the migration process, even though I’ve been working with (or near) the new toolset for some time.\nPart of my nervousness stems from earlier experiences, which have included some rather…dramatic results.\nNo matter how well you plan, something always seems to go sideways. And, truth be told, there were a couple of glitches along the way. (Fortunately, I noticed and resolved things quickly.)\nThe new site is built using Hugo in conjunction with the Docsy theme. It’s deployed using Github pages, which should be fine for the amount of traffic I get. (I do have a scaling plan in case things blow up, but I highly doubt that’s going to happen.)\nContent is maintained in a private repo and updates are synchronized to a public repo. (I plan to write a couple of articles walking through the process.)\nThis approach and architecture is meant to show what you can accomplish with minimal investment. Except for domain registration, the site currently relies on free services.\nA number of companies take similar approaches for their docs. Microsoft, for example, maintains private and public repos for Microsoft Learn, their doc site. They get the benefit of public contributions while securing product release plans until they’re ready to be unveiled.\nSo how long did this makeover take? Roughly ten days from start to finish:\nA prototype was “publishable” in three days.\nGranted, I wouldn’t have wanted to publish that version, but I could have if pressed.\nThe following week was spent testing, tweaking, and refining.\nThis included reworking previous articles, adding support material, and writing new articles.\nThe actual site migration took about 30 minutes overall.\nTiming started with adding a notice to the previous version of the site, just in case things went terribly wrong.\nI considered migration complete when the public URLs were updated.\nMigration was handled carefully. Each step was tested and verified.\nThis helped identify a few issues and I’ve filed tickets accordingly. (Yes, I have a private Jira project to track work for the site.)\nI think the new site works at least as well as the earlier one. That may seem like a modest win (table stakes, some would say). And, yet…how many times have we seen larger projects stumble because of less attention to detail?\nSo here we are. Is the site everything I imagined? Not entirely. But, I think it is an improvement and it sets a solid foundation for additional work.\nWith luck, the next major update will happen within days. And, with more luck (and diligence), that will only be the beginning.\nQapla'!\n","categories":"","description":"The site has been updated.
