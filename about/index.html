    <p>This is the personal site for Lance Leonard: a technical writer, programmer, and creative problem solver currently operating somewhere in the vicinity of Seattle.</p>

<p><a name="contact_info"></a>Contact info: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lleonard">LinkedIn</a> * <a href="https://twitter.com/ll_quips">Twitter</a></p>

<h2 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2>

<p>Opinions and ideas expressed on this site are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of my employer, family, friends, or anyone able to rub two synapses together.  Information is provided as-is with no guarantee as to accuracy, completeness, fitness of purpose, etc, and so on.  I warrant only that it worked on my machine well enough to write up.  I've tried to draw conclusions based on reproducible results and verifiable sources, but information on the Internet grows stale over time.  Your mileage may, and perhaps should, vary.  If it does, that's your own lookout.  Burn after reading; the Secretary disavows all knowledge.</p>

<p>(If you find a typo or technical error, please let me know.  My response will likely depend on my ability to replicate your findings, your level of professionalism/courtesy, the phase of the moon, and other secret ingredients unlikely to be revealed at the moment.)</p>

<h2 id="fair-warnings">Fair warnings</h2>

<p>Occasionally, I receive email asking if I'm a particular Lance Leonard.  I'll admit to being <em>a</em> Lance Leonard, but perhaps not <em>the</em> Lance Leonard you're looking for.  (<em>"Haven't you heard?  I come in six-packs."</em>)</p>

<p>For example, I am <strong>not</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A conservative politician from New Jersey. (You've likely reversed the names, not to mention the, well, never mind.  It's not that sort of site.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Formerly of any confection or beverage companies; the email addresses are close, but different.  Please look again.</p>

    <p>And, since the subject's been broached… Dude.  It's embarrassing to receive someone else's private correspondence—especially correspondence that really should remain, well, private.  The senior executives of <em>my</em> acquaintance usually know someone who can help them obtain unique digital identities.  Has your mileage varied?  'Nuff said?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the insurance game.  Nope; I'm a technical guy…a geek through and through.  And I've got the funny-shaped dice to prove it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dead….at least not yet.  That may change at some point and I cannot guarantee that I'll be able to update the site accordingly.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You've been warned.</p>

<p>I suppose I should admit that I've:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Been to New Jersey (Still miss the footlongs on the waterfront)</li>
  <li>Lived in California (Santa Cruz, if you must know)</li>
  <li>Done project work for a notable beverage company</li>
  <li>Worked for a life insurance/investment company</li>
  <li>Played dead on stage</li>
</ul>

<p>But those are all meaningless coincidences typical in a life of adventure.  None of them mean I'm the guy you're looking for.  Nope.  Nuh-uh.  I didn't do it.  No one saw me do it.  Can't prove a thing.  Pay no attention to the geek behind the content.  You can go about your business.  Move along.  Move along.</p>

<p>Oh, one last thing before you go.  Even if I <em>might</em> be the guy you <em>think</em> you're looking for, I very probably can't help you locate the person you lost track of way back when.  Life is frequently weird.  The <em>once-possible</em> sometimes becomes the <em>opportunity-missed</em>, the <em>forever-broken</em>, the <em>legally-constrained</em>, the <em>ethically-restrained</em>, and so on.  As certain a Formican once noted repetitiously, "Change happens."</p>

<p>More plainly: If I say I cannot help you, I probably can't…and I may not be in a position to explain why.  Please respect that.</p>

<p>And, yes, my sense of humor has been influenced by Douglas Adams, Charles Addams, Harlan Ellison, and Monty Python.  Why do you ask?</p>
